# Trespass Towing Analysis

Trespass towing is the act of hauling a vehicle from one location to another without the consent of the vehicleâ€™s owner. In Montgomery County, Maryland more than 100,000 vehicles have been towed in this manner since July 2021. 

By law, each invoice received for a trespass tow must include information prompting the vehicle owner to contact the Montgomery County Office of Consumer Protections with any complaints. In addition to investigating these complaints and ensuring merchants comply with regulations, the Office of Consumer Protections aims to reduce the number of trespass tows. The county enlisted Montgomery College to explore the data surrounding these cases, as well as some of the complaints filed against them. The goal of this partnership was to assess the trends in County tow data by analyzing County towing locations, towing agencies, and the towing populations while applying a racial equity and social justice lens.

     The core of the data used to analyze trespass towing comes from a database maintained by the Montgomery County Police Department. An updated dataset is published to the dataMontgomery website monthly. Its current version includes over 100,000 entries detailing the the date each vehicle was towed, its location (address and coordinates), the reason it was towed, and information on the vehicle's make, model, and year of manufacture.
     
   - Trespass Towing Complaints

     The Office of Consumer Protections also provided data on trespass towing complaints filed in the 2024 fiscal year. This data includes the location of the tow, the merchant in question, the practice being disputed, and the result of the case. Details regarding these complaints can be found in the dashboard created for this project. The dataset itself is not provided to preserve the privacy of the consumers.

        The Trespass Towing dataset required a great deal of data wrangling. Much of the data had to be parsed from the notes column.

### [Google Colab Python](googlecolab.md)

Four tools in the form of web apps were developed over the course of this project. The aim of creating these prototypes was to demonstrate that there exists a variety of ways that data-driven solutions can be utilized to mitigate the issues uncovered in this research. 

## [Web Apps](Webapp.md)
1. [Ranking Towing Company](https://towrank.netlify.app)

   The Tow Ranking web app demonstrates the capability of this or similar data to rank merchants on their level of deviation from the mean. Applications based on different measures can be developed as their importance is uncovered. More information and calculations can be found [here](ranking-app.md).

3. [Towr](https://towr.netlify.app)

   The Towr app is aimed at consumers. Its purpose is to prevent trespass tows from occuring by educating vehicle owners on where vehicles have been towed from in the past. Consumers looking to park their vehicle may look up an address, or share their location with the app, and will be met with a map indicating locations nearby that have seen trespass tows in the past 3 years.
